Solana was introduced by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017 when the Solana Whitepaper [10] was published. However, the whitepaper is no longer up-to-date and we haven’t found documentation that would meet our needs - to provide study material for the School of Solana.
That is why this handbook was created. Its purpose is to introduce the reader to the Solana blockchain. It should serve as an entry point for new Solana developers or blockchain enthusiasts wishing to learn about Solana.


The handbook is structured as follows:

- Beginning with <u>**Chapter 1**</u>, Blockchain Terminology, it clarifies fundamental concepts.
- <u>**Chapter 2**</u>, Solana Introduction, provides initial insights into Solana.
- <u>**Chapter 3**</u>, Solana Core Concepts, delves deeply into the platform's foundational ideas.
- <u>**Chapter 4**</u>, the Programming Model, talks about its operational framework.
- Continuing, <u>**Chapter 5**</u>, Solana Program Library discusses available resources provided by the Program Library.

Appendices cover various domains:

- <u>**Appendix A**</u> - Ecosystem, introduces you into the Solana Ecosystem.
- <u>**Appendix B**</u> - NFT, provides technical insights into NFTs.
- <u>**Appendix C**</u> - Gaming, details about upcoming Web3 and Games.

This comprehensive handbook functions as an ideal primer for those embarking on
a journey to understand Solana. We wholeheartedly welcome any input, be it identifying
errors or suggesting expansions, to enhance this resource.
