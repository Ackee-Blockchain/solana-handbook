# Why Solana Handbook?


Solana was introduced by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017 when the Solana Whitepaper [10] was
published. However, the whitepaper is no longer up-to-date and we haven’t found
documentation that would meet our needs - to provide study material for the School of
Solana.

That is why this handbook was created. Its purpose is to introduce the reader to the
Solana blockchain. It should serve as an entry point for new Solana developers or
blockchain enthusiasts wishing to learn about Solana.
