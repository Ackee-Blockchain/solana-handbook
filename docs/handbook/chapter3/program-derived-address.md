## Program Derived Address

Programs can issue instructions that include accounts that were not signed in the original transaction by using **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)**. These accounts are referred to as PDA accounts. PDAs allow for programmatically generated addresses to be used without needing a private key when invoking instructions of other programs.

PDA is an address deterministically derived from the **program ID** and **supplied seeds** (keywords). However, the resulting address is bumped off the Ed25519 curve with a so-called **bump seeds**. This ensures that no private key exists for the PDA.

## PDA Generation

When generating a PDA there is approximately 50% chance that the address will fall on the elliptic curve, meaning it has a corresponding private key. To avoid this, system uses bump seeds, an 8-bit number, to "bump" the address off the curve.

!!! insight

    To find a suitable bump seed, the program iterates through possible values from 255 down to 0. The first bump that works is known as the **canonical bump**.

!!! warning

    Other bump seeds beyond the canonical bump may also result in a valid PDA. However, for security reasons, it is recommended to **only use the canonical bump**.

When a program tries to invoke a [CPI](./cross-program-invocation.md) with PDA, the runtime takes the supplied keywords and bump seeds, uses the callerâ€™s program ID, and repeats the process. If the resulting PDA matches, the account is considered to be signed.
