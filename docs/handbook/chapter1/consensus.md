# Consensus

To agree on a certain state of a blockchain, network nodes need to reach a consensus. We assume there are malicious nodes in the network. Therefore, the system must be able to withstand not only simple node failures but also attacks to a certain extent. BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) is thus a desired property of such a distributed system.
Currently, only three viable consensus families can be used in practice. The first is the classic PBFT-like (Practical BFT) algorithm family [6]. The second is a so-called Nakamoto consensus, which couples a Sybil protection mechanism of Proof-of-Work with the longest-chain rule, a novel consensus invented by Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin in 2008 [2]. The third and newest family of consensus protocols known today is called Snow. Yet it is better known by its implementation name â€“ Avalanche Consensus [7], introduced in 2018 and used for the Avalanche cryptocurrency.
