# Protocol

Protocol is a common set of rules network nodes must follow. It defines things like communication between P2P (Peer-to-Peer) nodes, transaction format for everyone intending to use the network, any special features, and everything else for the network to operate correctly and for the users to know how to transact over the network. An essential part of a good protocol for a decentralized blockchain network is the proper incentive setup; this creates the need for its native coin.
