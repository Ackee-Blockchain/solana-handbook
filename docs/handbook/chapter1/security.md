# Security

Consensus and Sybil resistance mechanism are often confused as the same thing, which is not true and is worth pointing out. One works in conjunction with the other. Let’s look at how this works in both PoW-based and PoS-based networks.
Consider what makes Bitcoin, a PoW-based network, theoretically secure – it is the fact that only the longest chain is respected, also commonly known as the longest chain rule. This is why the consensus is called, as mentioned before, the Nakamoto consensus.
For a PoS-based network, the Sybil resistance mechanism is usually associated with a variant of a PBFT-like algorithm or the novel Avalanche consensus.
