# Nodes

Node is a term from graph theory or distributed systems; it is a single participant in a network. The nodes communicate with each other according to the protocol and in a P2P manner forming the whole blockchain network. There might be more types of nodes that are not equal, e.g., validator nodes securing the network or pure RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes used only to query the network and post new transactions. Their functions may overlap.
