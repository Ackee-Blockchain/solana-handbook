# Transaction

Transaction is a protocol-defined message that is stored as a part of a block, which is then stored as a part of a blockchain. The content usually consists of some kind of value transfer or on-chain program execution. Transactions are cryptographically signed by their authors, proving their authenticity. In the case of a value transfer, ownership of the funds or tokens often represents some value in the real world.
