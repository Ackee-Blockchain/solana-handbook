## Transaction

Transaction is a protocol-defined message that is stored as a part of a block, which is then stored as a part of a blockchain. The content usually consists of some kind of value transfer or on-chain program execution. Transactions are cryptographically signed by their authors, proving their authenticity.

!!! note

    In the context of a value transfer, ownership of the funds or tokens often represents some value in the real world, which is being transferred from one party to another.


## Instruction

A transaction is made up of one or more instructions. An instruction is a lower-level command that tells the blockchain what action to perform. These actions can include transferring tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or even creating new accounts.

!!! info

    Instructions are the building blocks of transactions. A single transaction can contain multiple instructions, allowing it to perform complex operations in one go.
