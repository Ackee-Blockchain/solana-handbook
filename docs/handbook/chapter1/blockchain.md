# Blockchain

A blockchain can be thought of as a series of blocks or an append-only data structure
that resembles an ordered back-linked linked list, which uses hashes as pointers to
previous blocks (Figure 1.1). This structure consists of blocks that form a chain, hence the
term blockchain. It can be easily concluded that it is a very simple data structure.
