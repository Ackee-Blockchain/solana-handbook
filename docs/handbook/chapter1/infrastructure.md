# Coin

Coins motivate participation in the network. They are usually paid with every new block to miners or validators for their help in securing the network. Without the proper incentives, any decentralized blockchain network falls apart.

# Protocol

Protocol is a common set of rules network nodes must follow. It defines things like communication between P2P (Peer-to-Peer) nodes, transaction format for everyone intending to use the network, any special features, and everything else for the network to operate correctly and for the users to know how to transact over the network. An essential part of a good protocol for a decentralized blockchain network is the proper incentive setup; this creates the need for its native coin.


# Nodes

Node is a term from graph theory or distributed systems; it is a single participant in a network. The nodes communicate with each other according to the protocol and in a P2P manner forming the whole blockchain network. There might be more types of nodes that are not equal, e.g., validator nodes securing the network or pure RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes used only to query the network and post new transactions. Their functions may overlap.
