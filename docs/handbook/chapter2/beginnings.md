Solana, founded by Anatoly Yakovenko in 2017 with the publication of the Solana Whitepaper, introduced Proof-of-History (PoH), a novel mechanism for synchronizing time across distributed systems without mutual trust.

The main value proposition of Solana is solving the blockchain trilemma, i.e., delivering
scalability, decentralization, and security without sacrificing any of the three mentioned features.

Solana officially launched its mainnet, still labeled as beta, in March 2020, with its native coin SOL incentivizing validator nodes and mitigating network spam through transaction fee payments.
