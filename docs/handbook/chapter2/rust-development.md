# Rust Development

Solanaâ€™s ecosystem revolves around the Rust programming language and its ecosystem. The main and only implementation of the node software is written in it. Also, Solana programs are almost exclusively written in Rust. Although there is no technical barrier preventing from using C or C++, Rust is the most supported language for developing on Solana. All the libraries and supporting code that can be found are written in it, leaving practically no other option.
