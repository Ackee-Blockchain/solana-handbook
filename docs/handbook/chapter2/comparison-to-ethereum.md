# Comparison to Ethereum

Solana is a smart contract platform. Compared to Ethereum, smart contracts on Solana are called Programs. They can be executed in parallel. Parallelization is one of the key differences from other platforms. While Ethereum can be considered a single-threaded distributed computing platform, Solana can be viewed as a multi-threaded one.

Solana makes itself clear to focus on improving scalability from the engineering perspective. It is rethinking and reengineering core parts that were first seen in Ethereum and making them parallel and optimized, including the usage of Nvidia CUDA to speed up certain parts of the code and invent its own specialized horizontally scalable database system for state storage and other things that are supposed to make it possible to reach maximum TPS practically only bounded by the network throughput, memory throughput and the number of CUDA cores in modern Nvidia GPUs. Therefore over time, it should scale with better hardware available on the market and internet connectivity in the world.
