# Candy Machine

The Metaplex Protocol Candy Machine is the leading minting and distribution program for fair NFT collection launches on Solana. Much like its name suggests, you can think of a Candy Machine as a temporary structure which is first loaded by creators and then unloaded by buyers. It allows creators to bring their digital assets on-chain in a secure and customisable way.

The name refers to the vending machines that dispense candy for coins via a mechanical crank. In this case the candy are NFTs and the payment is SOL or a SPL token.

By September 2022, 78% of all NFTs in Solana were minted through Metaplexâ€™s Candy Machine. This includes most of the well known NFT projects in the Solana ecosystem.

Here are some of the features it offers.

- Accept payments in SOL, NFTs or any Solana token.
- Restrict your launch via start/end dates, mint limits, third party signers, etc.
- Protect your launch against bots via configurable bot taxes and gatekeepers like Captchas.
- Restrict minting to specific NFT/Token holders or to a curated list of wallets.
- Create multiple minting groups with different sets of rules.
- Reveal your NFTs after the launch whilst allowing your users to verify that information.
- And so much more!

For illustrative purposes, we've included the Figure above. However, we won't delve deep into the intricate logic behind the Candy Machine Program, as such a detailed exploration would be too exhaustive for this guide. Our primary aim is to familiarize you with Solana and its burgeoning ecosystem. Those seeking a deeper understanding can delve further into this documentation.
