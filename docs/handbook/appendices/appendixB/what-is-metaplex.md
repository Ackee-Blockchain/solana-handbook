# What is Metaplex?

Metaplex is a decentralized protocol built on the Solana blockchain designed to simplify the creation, sale, and use of NFTs. By offering a suite of development tools, smart contracts, and open standards, Metaplex enables NFT communities to issue, manage, and own digital assets on-chain.

Metaplex continuously develops and maintains several programs and standards to enhance user experience and meet the evolving needs of its community.

Currently, major projects are

- Token Metadata - the NFT standard for Solana
- Candy Machine v3â„¢ - a Profile Picture (PFP) focused tool that works like the gumball-style candy machines of old. Candy Machine V3 supports the minting of programmable NFTs.
- Auction House - a decentralized sales protocol for NFT marketplaces
- Creator Studio - No-code tools to create, sell, and manage NFTs on Solana.
- Fixed-Price Sale - A program that enables creators to build/distribute membership NFTs at a fixed-price that grants holders access to exclusive content and events. It supports the restriction of sales to specific collection holders.
- Compression - A program for creating and interacting with compressed Metaplex NFTs. Compressed NFTs are secured on-chain using Merkle trees.
