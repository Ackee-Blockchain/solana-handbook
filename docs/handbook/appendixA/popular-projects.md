Solana's blockchain has become a fertile ground for innovation, attracting numerous high-profile projects due to its speedy, reliable, and scalable solutions for blockchain applications and technologies. Below, we've curated a list of some of the best-known names in their respective domains, but don't be misled; this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many more applications and projects thriving on the Solana platform, contributing to a vibrant and continually expanding ecosystem.

## Derivatives
Derivatives are products including options, futures, collateralized loans, and prediction markets, where an arrangement or instrument has a value derived from the underlying asset.

## Decentralized exchanges on Solana
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are a pivotal innovation in the world of cryptocurrency, allowing users to trade assets directly with one another without the need for an intermediary or centralized entity. Unlike traditional exchanges, where the exchange controls the user's funds, DEXs operate on smart contracts that handle the trading process. This design enhances security and privacy, as users retain control over their private keys. While offering benefits like reduced risk of hacking and censorship resistance, DEXs may face challenges such as lower liquidity and higher fees compared to centralized counterparts. Nevertheless, they represent a significant step towards a more decentralized and transparent financial ecosystem.

## Solana Liquid Staking
Liquid staking is a financial innovation within the crypto space that allows users to stake their assets while still having access to liquidity. Essentially, it lets participants earn staking rewards without locking up their tokens, by issuing synthetic or derivative tokens in return. This flexibility fosters greater participation and efficiency in proof-of-stake networks.

## Decentralized Lending on Solana
Decentralized lending refers to peer-to-peer lending practices conducted on blockchain networks. By using smart contracts, it eliminates traditional financial intermediaries, allowing users to borrow or lend funds directly to one another. This offers more accessible and potentially lower-cost lending options, promoting financial inclusion and greater control over personal finance.

## Marketplaces
There are multiple NFT marketplaces to trade NFTs (see Chapter 7 for more about NFTs), which are theoretically supposed to represent a certificate of ownership of something.
The trend of NFTs is closely coupled with an old-new concept of Metaverse, an artificial world where people could meet as virtual avatars and show off their collectible NFTs.
NFTs may find useful applications in the future for representing real-world items, such as concert tickets, but it remains to be seen if they offer any real advantage in practice or if the technology continues to be used largely for speculation.

## Tooling
Tools that enhance the safety of smart contracts facilitate thorough testing and validation, detecting vulnerabilities and errors. They improve the overall workflow of developing decentralized applications, ensuring robustness and security. Additionally, they enhance the usability of existing smart contracts, making them more accessible and efficient for users.

## Gaming
First games built on Solana are starting to appear, using the blockchain as a back end (see Appendix C for more about gaming) â€“ this type of development paradigm is referred to as Web3. In general, any application using blockchain as a layer of data and business logic can be considered Web3.
When a user visits such a website, they can usually connect their wallet with the website and interact with it by sending transactions that could, e.g., post a message on a Web3 social media platform or place an order on a decentralized exchange.
